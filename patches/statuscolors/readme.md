# statuscolors

A `color` property has been added to each block and a `defaultcolor` setting to the configuration. Must be applied with a dwm build with a corresponding statuscolors patch applied. The configured colors in the `schemes` map are the IDs of the schemes in the dwm scheme array. These will increase from one sequentially.

By default, comes configured for the patch defaults.
